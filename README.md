# Shopping-cart using vanilla Javascript

## Features implemented

1. Added a navbar
2. Added product cards - using javascript
3. Added +/- functionality to add items in basket
4. Added basket data to Local storage (prevents basket from resetting after every refresh)
5. Created the Cart Page
6. Added functionality to the Cart page - total price, remove item, clear cart

## Notes

1. When I changed the ids from number to random strings the value being passed to incerment/decrement became the whole element instead of just the element id which was happening before

2. If we link 2 javascript files in an HTML file, they will also be linked together and can use each others functions and variable
