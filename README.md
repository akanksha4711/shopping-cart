# Shopping-cart using vanilla Javascript

## Features implemented

1. Added a navbar
2. Added product cards - using javascript
3. Added +/- functionality to add items in basket
4. Added basket data to Local storage (prevents basket from resetting after each refresh)

# Notes

1. Changed the ids from number to random strings - had to make some changes in the code accordingly:the argument passed to incerment/decrement became the whole element instead of just the element id which was happening before
